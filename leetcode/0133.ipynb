    "# [133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)\n",
    "Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.\n",
    "ew\n",
    "```js\n",
    "class Node {\n",
    "    public int val;\n",
    "    public List<Node> neighbors;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test case format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.\n",
    "\n",
    "An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]\n",
    "Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]\n",
    "Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.\n",
    "1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).\n",
    "2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).\n",
    "3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).\n",
    "4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```js\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: adjList = [[]]\n",
    "Output: [[]]\n",
    "Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "Input: adjList = []\n",
    "Output: []\n",
    "Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].\n",
    "- 1 <= Node.val <= 100\n",
    "- Node.val is unique for each node.\n",
    "- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.\n",
    "- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.\n",
